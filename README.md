# Random Password Generator

## Descritpion

This weekâ€™s challenge required of me to create an application that can be used to generate a random password based on user's criteria. The app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. 

This challenge's criteria included:
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

I've made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* is deployed at live URL;
* resembles the example functionality provided in the challenge instructions.

As well as repository:
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions;
* follows best practices for variable naming conventions, indentation, quality commentary, etc;
* contains multiple descriptive commit messages, contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

Link to deployed application: https://karolinakulpinska.github.io/password-generator/

## Usage
